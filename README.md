# Project Description: Maths Game

The ***"Maths Game"*** project, developed in **C#**, is an *interactive console-based application designed to challenge players with a series of mathematical questions. 
Upon launching the game, players are greeted with a personalized welcome message and prompted to solve a set number of randomly generated mathematical expressions.*

# Description
Each question presents the player with an arithmetic expression to solve, with operands and operators generated within specified ranges. 
Players input their answers, and the game provides immediate feedback on the correctness of their responses. 
At the end of the game, players receive a final level score based on the percentage of correct answers.

# 
Finally this project demonstrates fundamental concepts of C# programming, including user input handling, random number generation, arithmetic operations, conditional logic, and output formatting within a console application. 
It provides an engaging and educational experience for players to sharpen their mathematical skills while enjoying a fun gaming environment.
